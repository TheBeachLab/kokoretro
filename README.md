# Kokoretro

This is a modified version of Kokopelli by Mathew Keeter, which I keep maintaning because I like to design circuit boards with it.

* Modified the scripts to specify python2
* Minor modifications for updated libraries

To run kokopelli retro mode:

```
make fab
cd bin
./kokopelli -r
```
